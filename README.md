## Hi ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Milica Ilic**, a passionate Data Science Engineer with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Medical Engineering & eHealth from FH Technikum Wien and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computing.

I specialize in developing and optimizing machine learning models, with expertise in deep learning, transfer learning, and signal processing. During my recent internship at the **Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, AKH Vienna**, I successfully developed a neural network for ECG delineation, showcasing my ability to apply AI to solve real-world challenges. My technical toolkit includes **Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, among others.

Some of my projects include:
- World Happiness Data Analysis and Visualization
- Hospital Review Sentiment Analysis with BI-LSTM (NLP)
- Target Variable Prediction: A Time-Series Modeling Project

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy reading and painting, and Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge in AI/ML.
